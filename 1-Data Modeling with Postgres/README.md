# Project: Data Modeling with Postgres.

## Introduction
A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analytics team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. Currently, they don't have an easy way to query their data, which resides in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

They'd like a data engineer to create a Postgres database with tables designed to optimize queries on song play analysis, and bring us on the project. our role is to create a database schema and ETL pipeline for this analysis. You'll be able to test our database and ETL pipeline by running queries given to you by the analytics team from Sparkify and compare your results with their expected results.

## Project Description
In this project, we'll apply what we've learned on data modeling with Postgres and build an ETL pipeline using Python. To complete the project, we will need to define fact and dimension tables for a star schema for a particular analytic focus, and write an ETL pipeline that transfers data from files in two local directories into these tables in Postgres using Python and SQL.

## Project Datasets

## Song Dataset
The first dataset is a subset of real data from the Million Song Dataset. Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json
song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json

And below is an example of what a single song file, TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json, looks like.

{"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}


### Log Dataset
The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this event simulator based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate activity logs from a music streaming app based on specified configurations.

The log files in the dataset we'll be working with are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json
log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json

And below is an example of what the data in a log file, 2018-11-12-events.json, looks like.

If we would like to look at the JSON data within log_data files, we will need to create a pandas dataframe to read the data. Remember to first import JSON and pandas libraries.

df = pd.read_json(filepath, lines=True)

For example, df = pd.read_json('data/log_data/2018/11/2018-11-01-events.json', lines=True) would read the data file 2018-11-01-events.json.

## Project Instructions

### Schema for Song Play Analysis
Using the song and log datasets, you'll need to create a star schema optimized for queries on song play analysis. This includes the following tables.

#### Fact Table
1. ***songplays*** - records in log data associated with song plays i.e. records with page NextSong
songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent

#### Dimension Tables
2. ***users*** - users in the app
    user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level
3. ***songs*** - songs in music database
    song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration
4. ***artists*** - artists in music database
    artist_id, name, location, latitude, longitude
5. ***time*** - timestamps of records in songplays broken down into specific units
    start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday
    
### Project Template

the data files includes six files:
1. `test.ipynb` displays the first few rows of each table to let me check my database.
2. `create_tables.py` drops and creates tables. I run this file to reset my tables before each time I run the ETL scripts.
3. `etl.ipynb` reads and processes a single file from song_data and log_data and loads the data into the tables. This notebook contains detailed instructions on the ETL process for each of the tables.
4. `etl.py` reads and processes files from song_data and log_data and loads them into the tables. It's based on my work in the ETL notebook.
4. `sql_queries.py` contains all my sql queries, and is imported into the last three files above.
5. `README.md` then provides an introduction to this project.


### Project Steps
Below are steps we can follow to complete the project:

#### Create Tables

Writing `CREATE` statements in `sql_queries.py` to create each table.
Writing `DROP` statements in `sql_queries.py` to drop each table if it exists.
Running `create_tables.py` to create our database and tables.
Running `test.ipynb` to confirm the creation of our tables with the correct columns. 


#### Build ETL Processes
Using the `etl.ipynb` develop ETL processes for each table. At the end of each table section, or at the end of the notebook, running `test.ipynb` to confirm that records were successfully inserted into each table. rerunning `create_tables.py` to reset your tables before each time we run this notebook.

#### Build ETL Pipeline
Using what we've completed in `etl.ipynb` to complete `etl.py`, where we'll process the entire datasets. running `create_tables.py` before running `etl.py` to reset tables. Running `test.ipynb` to confirm our records were successfully inserted into each table.
