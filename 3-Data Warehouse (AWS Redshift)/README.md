# Data-Warehouse-using-AWS-Redshift-service

## Introduction
A music streaming startup, Sparkify, has grown their user base and song database and want to move their processes and data onto the cloud. Their data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

As their data engineer, you are tasked with building an ETL pipeline that extracts their data from S3, stages them in Redshift, and transforms data into a set of dimensional tables for their analytics team to continue finding insights in what songs their users are listening to. You'll be able to test your database and ETL pipeline by running queries given to you by the analytics team from Sparkify and compare your results with their expected results.

## Project Description
In this project, I'll build a  data warehouses using AWS to build an ETL pipeline for a database hosted on Redshift. we will need to load data from S3 to staging tables on Redshift and execute SQL statements that create the analytics tables from these staging tables.

## Project Datasets
i'll working with two datasets that reside in S3. Here are the S3 links for each:

- Song data: s3://udacity-dend/song_data
- Log data: s3://udacity-dend/log_data
- Log data json path: s3://udacity-dend/log_json_path.json

## Song Dataset
The first dataset is a subset of real data from the Million Song Dataset. Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

<em>song_data/A/B/C/TRABCEI128F424C983.json<em>
<em>song_data/A/A/B/TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json<em>
And below is an example of what a single song file, <em>TRAABJL12903CDCF1A.json<em>, looks like.

<em>{"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null,"artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}<em>



## Log Dataset
The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this event simulator based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate app activity logs from an imaginary music streaming app based on configuration settings.

The log files in the dataset you'll be working with are partitioned by year and month. For example, here are filepaths to two files in this dataset.

<em>log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json<em>
<em>log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json<em>
And below is an example of what the data in a log file, 2018-11-12-events.json, looks like.

## Schema for Song Play Analysis
Using the song and event datasets, we'll need to create a star schema optimized for queries on song play analysis. This includes the following tables.

- Fact Table
songplays - records in event data associated with song plays i.e. records with page NextSong
songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent
- Dimension Tables
1. users - users in the app
    - user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level
2. songs - songs in music database
    - song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration
3. artists - artists in music database
    - artist_id, name, location, lattitude, longitude
4. time - timestamps of records in songplays broken down into specific units
    - start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday

## Project steps
  
- Create Table Schemas
1. Design schemas for our fact and dimension tables
2. Writing a SQL CREATE statement for each of these tables in sql_queries.py
3. Completing the logic in create_tables.py to connect to the database and creating these tables
4. Writing SQL DROP statements to drop tables in the beginning of create_tables.py if the tables already exist. This way, we can run create_tables.py whenever we want to reset the database and test the ETL pipeline.
5. Launching a redshift cluster and creating an IAM role that has read access to S3.
6. Adding redshift database and IAM role info to dwh.cfg.
7. Testing by running create_tables.py and checking the table schemas in our redshift database. we can use Query Editor in the AWS Redshift console for this.
  
- Build ETL Pipeline
1. Implementing the logic in etl.py to load data from S3 to staging tables on Redshift.
2. Implementing the logic in etl.py to load data from staging tables to analytics tables on Redshift.
3. Testing by running etl.py after running create_tables.py and running the analytic queries on your Redshift database to compare your results with the expected results.
4. Deleting the redshift cluster when finished.
